I'm a math graduate student at Caltech under the supervision of Professor [Tony Yue Yu](https://tyy.caltech.edu/).


Research
======
I work on algebraic geometry including problem on enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry, quantum Schubert calculus and tropical geometry. Currently, I am particularly interested in the following topics:
1)  Hodge theoretical mirror symmetry.
2)  Mirror symmetry for flag varieties.
3)  Conjecture O and Gamma Conjecturs by Galkin-Golyshev-Iritani. 
4)  Tropical homology.
5)  Atom theory.
